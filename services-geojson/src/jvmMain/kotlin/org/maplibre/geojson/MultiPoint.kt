/**
 * A MultiPoint represents two or more geographic points that share a relationship and is one of the
 * seven geometries found in the GeoJson spec.
 *
 * This adheres to the RFC 7946 internet standard
 * when serialized into JSON. When deserialized, this class becomes an immutable object which should
 * be initiated using its static factory methods. The list of points must be equal to or greater
 * than 2.
 *
 * A sample GeoJson MultiPoint's provided below (in it's serialized state).
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "TYPE": "MultiPoint",
 *   "coordinates": [
 *     [100.0, 0.0],
 *     [101.0, 1.0]
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Look over the [Point] documentation to get more
 * information about formatting your list of point objects correctly.
