/**
 * A multilinestring is an array of LineString coordinate arrays.
 *
 *
 * This adheres to the RFC 7946 internet standard when serialized into JSON. When deserialized, this
 * class becomes an immutable object which should be initiated using its static factory methods.
 *
 *
 * When representing a LineString that crosses the antimeridian, interoperability is improved by
 * modifying their geometry. Any geometry that crosses the antimeridian SHOULD be represented by
 * cutting it in two such that neither part's representation crosses the antimeridian.
 *
 *
 * For example, a line extending from 45 degrees N, 170 degrees E across the antimeridian to 45
 * degrees N, 170 degrees W should be cut in two and represented as a MultiLineString.
 *
 *
 * A sample GeoJson MultiLineString's provided below (in it's serialized state).
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "type": "MultiLineString",
 *   "coordinates": [
 *     [
 *       [100.0, 0.0],
 *       [101.0, 1.0]
 *     ],
 *     [
 *       [102.0, 2.0],
 *       [103.0, 3.0]
 *     ]
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Look over the [LineString] documentation to get more information about
 * formatting your list of linestring objects correctly.
 *
 * @param coordinates a list of {@link Point}s which make up the MultiLineString geometry
