/**
 * A GeoJson object MAY have a member named "bbox" to include information on the coordinate range
 * for its Geometries, Features, or FeatureCollections.
 *
 *
 * This class simplifies the build process for creating a bounding box and working with them when
 * deserialized. specific parameter naming helps define which coordinates belong where when a
 * bounding box instance is being created. Note that since GeoJson objects only have the option of
 * including a bounding box JSON element, the `bbox` value returned by a GeoJson object might
 * be null.
 *
 *
 * At a minimum, a bounding box will have two [Point]s or four coordinates which define the
 * box. A 3rd dimensional bounding box can be produced if elevation or altitude is defined.
 *
 * @param southwest represents the bottom left corner of the bounding box when the camera is pointing due north
